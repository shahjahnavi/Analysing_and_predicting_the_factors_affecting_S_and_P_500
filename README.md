## Sector Comparison

The code compares the performance of the S&P 500 Index to various sectors within the market. This includes analyzing the monthly mean close values for each sector and identifying sectors with similar or contrasting trends to the S&P 500 Index.

## Forecasting

 The code uses the ARIMA (1,1,0) model to forecast the Pfizer stock price for the next five years. The code also calculates the 95% confidence interval for the forecast.

## Findings

The closing price of Pfizer stock has been increasing steadily over the past four years.
The year 2022 has been the best performing year for Pfizer stock.
The monthly closing price of Pfizer stock tends to be higher in the second and third quarters.
The ARIMA (1,1,0) model is a good fit for forecasting the Pfizer stock price.

## Code Structure

The code is structured into sections for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, data visualization, and sector comparison. Each section contains comments to explain the code and its purpose.

## Dependencies

The code requires the following R packages:

* tidyverse
* ggplot2
* dplyr
* lubridate
* plotly
